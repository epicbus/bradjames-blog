## How on earth did I decide as a non-developer to go all-in on building with AI?

To answer this, I guess we need to look at my circumstances. Professionally I'm an all round Digital Marketer. This is great because I also love to Freedive. 

This is important because after spending 6 months teaching Freediving in Greece, I got back to NZ and my job and decided being chained to a desk wasn't really what I wanted. So I switched to Freelancing while I travel, train and compete as a Freediver. 

### Freelancing Marketing on gig sites. 

In my experience getting a solid marketing role, that pays well and is fully remote, isn't easy. Staying at my old job would have been 'the smart' decision. I had decent pay, was working for a great company that genuinely looked after me. But I had to physically be there, despite my job being one that definitely doesn't require in person work. 

I tried applying with companies, had a few interviews, but nothing panned out beyond that (maybe its me, maybe it's the whole remote thing). Either way I was set with savings for a while. I decided to use Upwork to try find some gigs. 

That shit is soul destroying. 

But after giving up on it, I was actually approached to work in Email Marketing - I jumped on it and have been working with them since. Having proof I've been working has helped land more projects. 

But the main issue - the rates are low, and most of the work I do is on the time tracker. This is great for me providing value and great for the client.
