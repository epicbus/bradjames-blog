## Welcome to My Journey

Hi, I'm Brad, and I'm not a developer. But I am determined to build an AI-powered marketing team that can amplify my output 10x.

### Why AI Agents?

The marketing landscape is changing rapidly. What used to require entire teams can now be accomplished with the right AI tools and automation. But here's the catch - most of these tools are either:

1. **Too generic** - They don't understand your specific business context
2. **Too expensive** - Enterprise solutions that cost thousands per month
3. **Too limited** - They do one thing well but don't integrate with your workflow

### What I'm Building

Instead of relying on off-the-shelf solutions, I'm building custom AI agents that:

- Understand my specific business and audience
- Work together as a coordinated team
- Get smarter over time as they learn from data
- Cost a fraction of hiring a full team

### The Plan

Over the coming weeks and months, I'll be documenting:

- How to build AI agents without a CS degree
- SEO strategies that actually work in 2025
- Marketing automation workflows
- Tools and frameworks I'm using
- Wins, failures, and lessons learned

### Why Share This Publicly?

Two reasons:

1. **Accountability** - Building in public keeps me honest and motivated
2. **Community** - I want to connect with others on the same journey

If you're interested in AI, marketing, or just building cool stuff, stick around. This is going to be an interesting ride.

## What's Next?

My first project is building an SEO agent that can analyze content, identify opportunities, and help optimize for search. I'll be sharing the entire process - code, prompts, and results.

Let's do this.
